## Abstract

The transport of intensity equation (TIE), a noninterferometric method for quantitative phase imaging (QPI), enables the characterization of transparent objects and is widely applied in fields such as biomedicine, materials science, and optical metrology. Traditional TIE methods require the mechanical movement of detectors to capture multiple images, which limits integration, stability, and speed of the system. 

In this work, we designed a varifocal metalens for TIE based QPI. This approach allows the acquisition of multiple defocused images without mechanical movement. Coupled with the High-order TIE algorithm, it yields a compact, stable, and accurate phase-imaging technique. Compared to a dual-channel polarization multiplexed metalens, phase reconstruction based on a varifocal metalens exhibits superior robustness and enhanced accuracy. The experimental results indicate that our method can accurately reconstruct the phase of objects with different phase gradients using partially coherent light illumination, achieving an average percentage error of less than 2.7%. 

This dynamic illumination approach, combined with specific metasurfaces, holds potential applications in realizing lightweight, compact, and multifunctional imaging systems.
