## Abstract

The control platform is capable of movement at speeds of up to 2.5 m/s. Image preprocessing utilises inverse perspective transformation and adaptive binarization, while template matching is employed for recognition purposes. The combination of images with the air posture speculation algorithm enables accurate location of the The position of the platform is aligned with the established map through the utilisation of probabilistic statistical methods to identify the relevant components within the map. Intelligent algorithms are employed, based on the simulated annealing algorithm and the adaptive cooling table, for the omnidirectional gaming platform, with the objective of planning the shortest moving path.
