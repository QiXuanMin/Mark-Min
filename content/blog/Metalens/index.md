## Abstract

The transport of intensity equation (TIE) is a non-interferometric method for quantitative phase imaging (QPI). TIE enables the characterization of transparent objects and is widely applied in fields such as biomedicine, materials science, and optical metrology. Traditional TIE methods require the mechanical movement of detectors to capture multiple images, which limits integration, stability, and speed of the system. 

In this work, we designed a linear polarization-dependent varifocal metalens for TIE based QPI. This approach allows the acquisition of multiple defocused images without mechanical movement. Coupled with the High-order TIE algorithm, it yields a compact, stable, and accurate phase-imaging technique. 

## Design

We simulated the nanostructures  by using *Lumerical FDTD Solution*, we scanned the parameter of nanostructure to get the phase and the transmittance distribution under different width and length. Figure 1 shows the schematics and design of the metalens.
